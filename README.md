## 📥 Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### Dataset

- CSV file: `cell_data.csv` must be available in your working directory or Colab environment.
- The file should contain attributes for cytology cell features and a classification label.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Preprocess the Dataset**
   - Handles missing values and encodes labels.
   - Scales features using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Build the ANN Model**
   - Sequential model with ReLU activations and sigmoid output.
   - Designed for binary classification tasks.

3. **Optimize with HHO Algorithm**
   - HHO is used instead of traditional backpropagation.
   - Loss and accuracy are tracked across iterations.

4. **Evaluate the Model**
   - Generates a confusion matrix and test accuracy.
   - Predicts sample input for quick inference.
   - Plots training loss and accuracy curves.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Binary classification of cell samples (Benign/Malignant).
- 🔧 Custom implementation of Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO).
- 📊 Accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss visualization.
- 📦 No use of built-in Keras training APIs – optimization is fully custom.
- 🧪 Predicts single sample after training completion.
- 📈 Loss and accuracy are plotted over epochs to monitor performance.

> ⚠️ **Note:** HHO is a metaheuristic optimizer and may take longer to converge than traditional gradient-based methods. Recommended to run in a GPU-enabled environment such as Google Colab.
